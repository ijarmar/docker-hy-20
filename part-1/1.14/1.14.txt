Because ruby on rails is a horrible piece of technology the only way I found to make this work is to:
1. replace the Gemfile with the one provided in this directory (because of weird bug with tzinfo-data package)
2. remove old Gemfile.lock
3. build the image with sudo docker build -t rails-example .
4. sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 rails-example
